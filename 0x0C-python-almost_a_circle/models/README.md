This folder contains three classes.
1.Base: this is the base for all of the models and itdefines the id of objects and keeps a record of all the models created. This class will be the “base” of all other classes in this project. The goal of it is to manage id attribute in all your future classes and to avoid duplicating the same code (by extension, same bugs)

2.Rectangle: this class inherits from the Base class.

3.Square: this inherits from Rectangle
